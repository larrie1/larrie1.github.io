    level1_description: 'Four animals are being studied in a research laboratory: a raven, a penguin, a mole and a dog. Each of these animals has different characteristics and abilities that set them apart from the other animals. The researchers want to use a decision tree to find out which animal can fly, which lives underground and which has feathers.',
    level1_task: 'The task is as follows: using the characteristics "feathers", "flies" and "life under the earth", determine which animal belongs to which properties. Is the given decision tree sufficient to clearly distinguish between the animals? If necessary, add further decisions. Check your tree if you are sure!',

    block_intro_4: 'By default, the block "only" has two choices, but you\'ll notice that you sometimes need more than one choice. To expand the block for this there is the plus icon at the top left corner of the block. If you press on this you can expand the node by one choice. After that, a minus symbol will also appear to remove the last choice added.',
    block_intro_3: 'Here you can select one of the given options. There can be different number of choices, so you should expand the block to cover all choices. If you use a choice twice, only the bottom choice within the block will be evaluated. For this reason, only record each election once.',
    block_intro_5: 'The block is structured like a puzzle piece, you can add a so-called parent block to this block in the upper left corner. The parent block\'s decision is relevant to the child block, since the data has already been split by it. You can add this block to the parent block by simply dragging it to the choice you want to connect it to and dropping it once they have connected.',
    block_intro_6: 'These are the bindings of your block. At this point, you can assign your choices to a following block, which further divides the data or includes a decision. To do this, simply drag the block to the point with the connecting piece from the upper left corner of the block to be connected.',
    block_intro_7: 'With the help of this block you can represent a leaf of the tree, i.e. a decision. Only the decision blocks that represent a decision from the task are made available to you. You can connect this to the decide block using the connector on the left.',
    block_intro_8: 'This is what a tree could look like when you represent it using the blocks. At the moment this block represents the decision about "Hot". If it is Hot, i.e. "Choice 1" is "true", then the decision "Good weather" has been made. Likewise with "Choice 2" and "false" the decision "Bad weather" was made.

    level5_description: 'Once upon a time, there was a passionate tennis player named Sarah. She loved nothing more than hitting the court and playing a few sets with her friends. However, Sarah knew that certain weather conditions could impact her game. One sunny morning, Sarah woke up and checked the weather app on her phone. She saw that the temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit, the humidity was 70%, the wind was 8 miles per hour, and the outlook was partly cloudy. Sarah knew that these factors could either make or break her tennis game. She started to think about her preferences for each of these factors. She didn\'t mind playing in warm weather, but 85 degrees might be pushing it. She preferred the humidity to be lower than 60%, and the wind to be no more than 5 miles per hour. As for the outlook, she didn\'t mind playing in partly cloudy conditions, but she preferred a sunny day. So Sarah decided to make a decision based on her preferences. She checked the temperature and saw that it was a bit too hot for her liking. The humidity was also a bit high, and the wind was stronger than she preferred. She looked at the outlook and saw that it was partly cloudy. After considering all of these factors, Sarah decided to skip tennis for the day. She knew that the weather conditions could make it difficult to play her best game, and she didn\'t want to risk injury or frustration. Instead, she opted to stay home, relax, and plan to play tennis another day when the weather was more to her liking.',
